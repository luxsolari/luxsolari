## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Lux Solari.

I am a Software Developer from Argentina with experience in Java and C++.

I worked professionaly since 2016 on various consulting firms, including Accenture and Globant.

I am currently working as a backend dev on Mercado Libre (MELI).

I also study game development as a hobby and do little games or side projects for fun.

Also like doing photography, you can find me at @lux.solari on Instagram!
