## Hi there 👋 I'm Lux Solari. 
_(Also known in _realspace_ as **Luciano Laje**)._

I am a Software Developer from Buenos Aires, Argentina with experience in Java, C++.<br>
I worked professionaly since 2016 on various consulting firms, including Accenture and Globant.

🔭 I am currently working as a backend dev on Mercado Libre (MELI), researching and developing GenAI initiatives for development acceleration.

🌱 I’m currently learning (in no particular order)...
  - AI stuff (Context Engineering, Prompt Engineering, Rules...)
  - More Java/JVM stuff (for day job, mostly)
  - More languages (more C++, Kotlin, Swift, Go)
  - iOS / Swift development
  - Android development / Kotlin for Android
  - Web development stuff, for personal site creation mostly.
  
🕹️ I also do game development as a hobby and do little games or side projects for fun, or as an excuse to learn/apply something of the listed above.

📷 Also like doing photography, you can find me at [@lux.solari](instagram.com/lux.solari) on Instagram!

  - I shoot, develop and edit my own analog/film photos.
  - I also do some darkoom copying on my home-made darkoom lab.
  - I love 35mm film, film emulation, vintage looking photos, b/w photography...
