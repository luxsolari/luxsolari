## Hi there üëã I'm Lux Solari. 
_(Also known in _realspace_ as **Luciano Laje**)._

I am a Software Developer from Buenos Aires, Argentina with experience mostly in Java, and some C++ and C#.<br>
I work professionaly since 2016 on various consulting firms, including Accenture and Globant.

üî≠ I am currently working as a backend dev on Mercado Libre (MELI), researching and developing GenAI initiatives for development acceleration.

üå± I‚Äôm currently learning (in no particular order)...
  - AI stuff (Context Engineering, Prompt Engineering, Rules...)
  - More Java/JVM stuff (for day job, mostly)
  - More languages (more C++, Kotlin, Swift, Go)
  - iOS / Swift development
  - Android development / Kotlin for Android
  - Web development stuff, for personal site creation mostly.
  
üïπÔ∏è I also do game development as a hobby and do little games or side projects for fun, or as an excuse to learn/apply something of the listed above.

üì∑ Also like doing photography, you can find me at [@lux.solari](instagram.com/lux.solari) on Instagram!

  - I shoot, develop and edit my own analog/film photos.
  - I also do some darkoom copying on my home-made darkoom lab.
  - I love 35mm film, film emulation, vintage looking photos, b/w photography...

üóÉÔ∏è Use these links to download the `.profile` settings for the three major editors I use:
  - [VS Code](https://github.com/luxsolari/luxsolari/blob/master/VSCode.code-profile)
  - [Windsurf](https://github.com/luxsolari/luxsolari/blob/master/Windsurf.code-profile)
  - [Cursor](https://github.com/luxsolari/luxsolari/blob/master/Cursor.code-profile)
- They have a load of extensions for many things, so I don't have to spend two weeks setting everything up every time I re-install my computers.
